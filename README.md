## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a structured SQL practice exercise focused on **database design, table relationships, and query operations** using real-world employee and department data.

The project simulates an organizational database where employees are assigned to departments, enabling practice of SQL concepts from basics to intermediate level.
